# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my ML-Projects repository! ðŸ‘‹

## About

This repository is a collection of machine learning projects that I have completed as an entry-level data scientist. Each folder contains a standalone project that demonstrates my understanding of data science concepts, programming in Python, and the application of machine learning algorithms to real-world datasets.

## Projects

Below are the projects currently included in this repository:

1. **Project 1:** _[Bank Churn Prediction]_  
   - In this project, i had to build a Neural Network Model that would be able to predict whether a custormer of a Bank
   would churn or not. I did try to experiment with some different optimizers in an attempt to fine tune the model and get the best possible accuracy.

2. **Project 2:** _[Credit Card Users Churn Prediction]_  
   - In this project I had to apply my understanding of ensemble learning techniques to try to create a model that would predict whether credit card custormers would churn or not based on the given data.

3. **Project 3:** _[Food Hub Data Analysis]_  
   - This is my very first Project as a Data Scientist. I had to do some EDA on data provided by an app called FoodHub. After said EDA, I had to provide some insights on some stuff I saw to be hindering performing and ways they can achieve better performance.

4. **Project 4:** _[Loan Modeling Project]_  
   - In this project i had to predict whether a liability customer will buy personal loans using a Decision Tree Classifier. I also had apply some EDA to understand which customer attributes are most significant in driving purchases, and identify which segment of customers to target more.

5. **Project 5:** _[Plant Seedling Classification]_  
   - This is my first Computer Vision Project. My Job was to build a Convoluted Neural Network to classify plant Seedlings into their respective categories.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Tensorflow
- Ensemble Learning techniques (RandomForest, XGBOOST, Gradient Boost etc)

## Getting Started

To run any of these projects on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gilquarshie/ML-Projects.git
   cd ML-Projects
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Navigate to the project folder of interest and follow its README or notebook instructions.**

## How to Use

- Each project folder contains a README or a Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step instructions.
- Datasets (if not included) are referenced with download links or instructions.
- Feel free to explore, run, and modify the code!
