## Projects

Below are the projects currently included in this repository:

1. **Bank Churn Prediction**  
   Developed a Neural Network model to predict whether a bank customer would churn. The project involved experimenting with various optimizers to fine-tune the model and achieve optimal accuracy.

2. **Credit Card Users Churn Prediction**  
   Applied ensemble learning techniques to predict credit card customer churn based on provided data. Explored and compared different ensemble methods for improved model performance.

3. **Food Hub Data Analysis**  
   Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on data from the FoodHub app. Provided actionable insights and identified key factors hindering business growth.

4. **Loan Modeling Project**  
   Built a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a liability customer would purchase a personal loan. Incorporated EDA to determine the most influential customer attributes.

5. **Plant Seedling Classification**  
   Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification, categorizing plant seedlings into their respective classes. This project marked my introduction to computer vision.
